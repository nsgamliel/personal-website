Title

Hi, I'm Natan

Intro

I'm a software developer based in Massachusetts. I pride myself on my
independent problem-solving skills reinforved by curricular and industry
software development experience. Currently, I am searching for a full-time
position that will allow me to exercise these skills in an environment that
emphasizes collaboration and encourages my personal growth as a software
developer
