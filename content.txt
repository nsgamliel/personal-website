Hi, I'm Natan

Hero
I enjoy building cool stuff and am looking for opportunities to do so while learning from talented people. 
I believe in the importance of learning by doing and engaging in learning purely for its own sake. This website represents my effort to combine both ideals.


I'm a software developer based in Massachusetts. I pride myself on my
independent problem-solving skills reinforved by curricular and industry
software development experience. Currently, I am searching for a full-time
position that will allow me to exercise these skills in an environment that
emphasizes collaboration and encourages my personal growth as a software
developer
notes: too long, too formal, too limited in scope
